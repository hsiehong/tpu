## [Project Description](https://hackmd.io/@hsieh22/aic2021-tpu_spec)

* In this project, I implement a systolic array to do `m*k` * `k*n` matrix multiplication, where the constraint of `m`, `k`, `n` are `1 < m, k, n < 10`
     
    
## Project Architecture
* Overview of this project, mainly I implement the TPU part to do matrix multiply operation.

* Overview Architecture of `TPU` module

* Overview Architecture of `PE` module
* notice that I accumulate partial sum in other buffer, not store in `PE`ï¼Œthe jobs `PE` will do are that multiple and transfer input data to next `PE`

## Data preprocess flow & Data flow
* Take a example for two matrix multiplication `A` and `B`, `A` is `9*9` and `B` is `9*9`, the red frame and number on matrix is the input order.
* `A` : ![](https://i.imgur.com/8mZGtrR.png)
    
*  `B` : ![](https://i.imgur.com/M1yWLiu.png)
    
* Because the design of systolic array is 4*4, we can do at most 4 rows in a round, that is limited by the size of systolic array, at the same time I read whole column each round, which is limited by `k`, so I set it to the max size `9`, if the input matrix is less than 9, the remaining value will be padded 0.
    
* In my design, I read `4*9` input each round and store them, at the same time I read input, I will adjust them to suitable format, so when I read done the input, I can easily feed the adjusted array to my PE.
* Take example for first round, the input array will be adjusted to a parallelogram array, the padding zeros are required in order to let the item meet in the correct time and position.
* After (k+7) cycle(include a delay cycle), each round will get the correct value, then write back to global buffer.

* Because I want to make the output index contiguous, according to the rule of matrix multiplication, I fixed the buffer of matrix `b` until all rows in matrix `a` has benn calculate, so the content of next round should be:

* There is still one row not be calculated, the unsufficient rows will be padded 0, so the next round should be

* Then I do the same action to matrix `b`, until the all operation is done.
